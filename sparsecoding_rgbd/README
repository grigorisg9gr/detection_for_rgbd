===========

This is the extension of sparsecoding to include RGBD images.
This is the companion code-release to my thesis with title: "Deformable object detection with RGBD images".

To run the code and reproduce the results: 
1) the code is in PASCAL directory, where you need to change the startup file to include your paths, globals_new() (in new_code_greg/) 
2) run_hsc_pascal() is the main function
